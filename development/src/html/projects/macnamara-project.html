						<h1>Mc Namara House</h1>
						<p class="project-intro">The Mc Namara house, located in Kildalkey, Co. Meath, west of medieval Trim, in the historic Boyne Valley, at the junction of the ancient Slíghe Chualann, the ancient roadway of the Irish high-kings.</p> 
						<p>Meandering laneways, hawthorn hedgerows and a mature Ash tree, sets the backdrop for this graceful modern dwelling, a modest house for a farmer. Representing a modern approach to sustainable living in the Irish landscape, achieving the NZEB standard. The house is expressed as two simple forms, each responding in height to its function. When viewed across the fields of fertile landscape, one reminisces the familiar whitewashed farmhouse.</p>

							<p>I’d a vision of my home, different to the standard bungalows you see around the country. I wanted something bright, economical and healthy to live in. I had a limited budget. 
</p>
							<p>I decided to engage Cooney Architects due to their track record and belief in sustainability. Working with them was an amazing experience, they listened to my requests, took on board my current lifestyle and possible future needs. They came up with a number of ideas such as: two separate living areas; the bedroom and living wings, the concept of the courtyard area (I’d previously lived in an old house with a courtyard).  Their attention to detail was phenomenal.</p>
							<p>I placed my faith in good architects and I feel that it has paid off. They took my vision made it a reality.</p>

							<p>‘Home Farm, While a tight budget meant some of the more ambitious eco features planned for this simple and graceful new farmhouse had to be dropped, it still manages to meet Irelands standard for nearly energy buildings (nZEBs) thanks to a combination of superb detailing and Fabric-first design.</p>
